Bubble Sort and Selection sort are the two most inefficient ways of sorting data that we have learned. This can be
seen in this lab, the graphs provided, and by the complexity. Bubble Sort uses two nested for loops with an if
statement in the inner for loop. Due to this, the worst case of bubble sort is O(N^2). However, if bubble sort is
optimized and used in the best case (a sorted list) its complexity can be as fast as O(N). In my alorithms used in this
lab, I did not optimize BubbleSort so the complexity is still O(N^2). Selection Sort also uses two nested for loop with
an if statement in the inner for loop. Due to this, the worst case for selection sort is O(N^2). Selection sort cannot
be optimized, so the complexity for the best case (a sorted list) is also O(N^2). Both bubble sort and selection sort
have a worst case complexity of O(N^2) making them extremely inefficient ways to sort data. If we need to sort a large
set of data efficiently, we should use one of the other sorting algorithms we learned in class.
